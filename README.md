**Kaggle: Pandas for Data Science**

This repository houses my work for the Pandas track on Kaggle. Pandas is the primary tool for data discovery and feature engineering in the Data Science and AI ecosystem.

**🛠️ Tech Stack**
* Language: Python

* Library: Pandas, NumPy

* Environment: Kaggle Notebooks / Jupyter

**📖 Modules Covered**
- Creating, Reading and Writing: Working with CSV and Excel files.

- Indexing, Selecting & Assigning: Precise data extraction using loc and iloc.

- Summary Functions and Maps: Deep dives into data distribution.

- Grouping and Sorting: Complex aggregations with groupby.

- Data Types and Missing Values: Cleaning "dirty" data for AI readiness.

- Renaming and Combining: Merging multiple data sources into one.

**🚀 Why This Matters**
Mastering these techniques is a prerequisite for any AI project. Clean data is the difference between a high-performing model and a failed experiment.
